Signal Denoising Using Integer Wavelet Transformation

#Introduction:
Wavelet is a function applied for processing digital signals and compression. Wavelet transforms a high-resolution signal into an approximated and detailed coefficient.
A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases or decreases, and then returns to zero one or more times.
The approximated coefficients are low-resolution approximations because they do not show what has changed. On the other hand, the detailed coefficient shows the changes and makes it possible to recover the original image from the approximated coefficients.

#The wavelet transform (WT)
The wavelet transform (WT) can be used to analyze signals in timeâ€“frequency space and reduce noise, while retaining the important components in the original signals. In the past 20 years, WT has become a very effective tool in signal processing. Currently, WT is widely used in numerous remote sensing applications, such as image fusion.
