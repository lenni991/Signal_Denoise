Signal Denoising Using Integer Wavelet Transformation



***The wavelet transform (WT)**
The wavelet transform (WT) can be used to analyze signals in timeâ€“frequency space and reduce noise, while retaining the important components in the original signals. In the past 20 years, WT has become a very effective tool in signal processing. Currently, WT is widely used in numerous remote sensing applications, such as image fusion.
