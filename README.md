Signal Denoising Using Integer Wavelet Transformation


**The wavelet transform (WT)**
The wavelet transform (WT) can be used to analyze signals in time–frequency space and reduce noise, while retaining the important components in the original signals. In the past 20 years, WT has become a very effective tool in signal processing. Currently, WT is widely used in numerous remote sensing applications, such as image fusion.
